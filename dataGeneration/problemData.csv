	Remove the smallest k elements and the largest k elements from the container.
	Calculate the average value for the rest of the elements rounded down to the nearest integer.


Implement the MKAverage class:


	MKAverage(int m, int k) Initializes the MKAverage object with an empty stream and the two integers m and k.

The kingdom has a well-defined order of inheritance that consists of the king as the first member. Let's define the recursive function Successor(x, curOrder), which given a person x and the inheritance order so far, returns who should be the next person after x in the order of inheritance.


Successor(x, curOrder):
    if x has no children or all of x's children are in curOrder:
        if x is the king return null
        else return Successor(x's parent, curOrder)
    else return x's oldest child who's not in curOrder


For example, assume we have a kingdom that consists of the king, his children Alice and Bob (Alice is older than Bob), and finally Alice's son Jack.


	In the beginning, curOrder will be [""king""].
	Calling Successor(king, curOrder) will return Alice, so we append to curOrder to get [""king"", ""Alice""].
	Calling Successor(Alice, curOrder) will return Jack, so we append to curOrder to get [""king"", ""Alice"", ""Jack""].
	Calling Successor(Jack, curOrder) will return Bob, so we append to curOrder to get [""king"", ""Alice"", ""Jack"", ""Bob""].
	Calling Successor(Bob, curOrder) will return null. Thus the order of inheritance will be [""king"", ""Alice"", ""Jack"", ""Bob""].


Using the above function, we can always obtain a unique order of inheritance.

1340,The Dining Philosophers,"Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.

Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. Each fork can be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not being used by another philosopher. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both forks so that the forks become available to others. A philosopher can take the fork on their right or the one on their left as they become available, but cannot start eating before getting both forks.

Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed.

Design a discipline of behaviour (a concurrent algorithm) such that no philosopher will starve; i.e., each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think.



The problem statement and the image above are taken from wikipedia.org

 

The philosophers' ids are numbered from 0 to 4 in a clockwise order. Implement the function void wantsToEat(philosopher, pickLeftFork, pickRightFork, eat, putLeftFork, putRightFork) where:


	philosopher is the id of the philosopher who wants to eat.

	eat is a function you can call to let the philosopher eat once he has picked both forks.
	putLeftFork and putRightFork are functions you can call to put down the corresponding forks of that philosopher.
	The philosophers are assumed to be thinking as long as they are not asking to eat (the function is not being called with their number).

1337,Design Skiplist,"Design a Skiplist without using any built-in libraries.

A Skiplist is a data structure that takes O(log(n)) time to add, erase and search. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists are just simple linked lists.

For example: we have a Skiplist containing [30,40,50,60,70,90] and we want to add 80 and 45 into it. The Skiplist works this way:


Artyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons

You can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add , erase and search can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).

To be specific, your design should include these functions:


	bool search(int target) : Return whether the target exists in the Skiplist or not.
	void add(int num): Insert a value into the SkipList. 
	bool erase(int num): Remove a value in the Skiplist. If num does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If there exists multiple num values, removing any one of them is fine.


See more about Skiplist : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list

Note that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.

 

Example:


Skiplist skiplist = new Skiplist();

skiplist.add(1);
skiplist.add(2);
skiplist.add(3);
skiplist.search(0);   // return false.
skiplist.add(4);
skiplist.search(1);   // return true.
skiplist.erase(0);    // return false, 0 is not in skiplist.
skiplist.erase(1);    // return true.
skiplist.search(1);   // return false, 1 has already been erased.

		R(""a"") = {""a""}
		R(""w"") = {""w""}
	
	
	When we take a comma delimited list of 2 or more expressions, we take the union of possibilities.
	
		R(""{a,b,c}"") = {""a"",""b"",""c""}
		R(""{{a,b},{b,c}}"") = {""a"",""b"",""c""} (notice the final set only contains each word at most once)

These threads should pass the barrier in groups of three, and they must be able to immediately bond with each other to form a water molecule. You must guarantee that all the threads from one molecule bond before any other threads from the next molecule do.

We don’t have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; that is, the threads do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up with. The key is just that threads pass the barrier in complete sets; thus, if we examine the sequence of threads that bond and divide them into groups of three, each group should contain one oxygen and two hydrogen threads.

		Example: wordlist = [""yellow""], query = ""YellOw"": correct = ""yellow""
		Example: wordlist = [""Yellow""], query = ""yellow"": correct = ""Yellow""
		Example: wordlist = [""yellow""], query = ""yellow"": correct = ""yellow""
	
	
	Vowel Errors: If after replacing the vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') of the query word with any vowel individually, it matches a word in the wordlist (case-insensitive), then the query word is returned with the same case as the match in the wordlist.
	
		Example: wordlist = [""YellOw""], query = ""yollow"": correct = ""YellOw""
		Example: wordlist = [""YellOw""], query = ""yeellow"": correct = """" (no match)
		Example: wordlist = [""YellOw""], query = ""yllw"": correct = """" (no match)
	
	


In addition, the spell checker operates under the following precedence rules:


	When the query exactly matches a word in the wordlist (case-sensitive), you should return the same word back.
	When the query matches a word up to capitlization, you should return the first such match in the wordlist.
	When the query matches a word up to vowel errors, you should return the first such match in the wordlist.

862,Find And Replace in String,"To some string S, we will perform some replacement operations that replace groups of letters with new ones (not necessarily the same size).

Each replacement operation has 3 parameters: a starting index i, a source word x and a target word y.  The rule is that if x starts at position i in the original string S, then we will replace that occurrence of x with y.  If not, we do nothing.

For example, if we have S = ""abcd"" and we have some replacement operation i = 2, x = ""cd"", y = ""ffff"", then because ""cd"" starts at position 2 in the original string S, we will replace it with ""ffff"".

Using another example on S = ""abcd"", if we have both the replacement operation i = 0, x = ""ab"", y = ""eee"", as well as another replacement operation i = 2, x = ""ec"", y = ""ffff"", this second operation does nothing because in the original string S[2] = 'c', which doesn't match x[0] = 'e'.

The circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle.

But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.

An email address starts with a name, followed by the symbol '@', followed by a name, followed by the dot '.' and followed by a name. 

All email addresses are guaranteed to be valid and in the format of ""name1@name2.name3"".

To mask an email, all names must be converted to lowercase and all letters between the first and last letter of the first name must be replaced by 5 asterisks '*'.


2. Phone number:

A phone number is a string consisting of only the digits 0-9 or the characters from the set {'+', '-', '(', ')', ' '}. You may assume a phone number contains 10 to 13 digits.

The local number should be formatted and masked as ""***-***-1111"", where 1 represents the exposed digits.

To mask a phone number with country code like ""+111 111 111 1111"", we write it in the form ""+***-***-***-1111"".  The '+' sign and the first '-' sign before the local number should only exist if there is a country code.  For example, a 12 digit phone number mask should start with ""+**-"".

815,Champagne Tower,"We stack glasses in a pyramid, where the first row has 1 glass, the second row has 2 glasses, and so on until the 100th row.  Each glass holds one cup of champagne.

Then, some champagne is poured into the first glass at the top.  When the topmost glass is full, any excess liquid poured will fall equally to the glass immediately to the left and right of it.  When those glasses become full, any excess champagne will fall equally to the left and right of those glasses, and so on.  (A glass at the bottom row has its excess champagne fall on the floor.)

For example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top most glass is full.  After two cups of champagne are poured, the two glasses on the second row are half full.  After three cups of champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now.  After four cups of champagne are poured, the third row has the middle glass half full, and the two outside glasses are a quarter full, as pictured below.

The format of the output is as follows:


	For each term of free variables with non-zero coefficient, we write the free variables within a term in sorted order lexicographically. For example, we would never write a term like ""b*a*c"", only ""a*b*c"".
	Terms have degree equal to the number of free variables being multiplied, counting multiplicity. (For example, ""a*a*b*c"" has degree 4.) We write the largest degree terms of our answer first, breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring the leading coefficient of the term.
	The leading coefficient of the term is placed directly to the left with an asterisk separating it from the variables (if they exist.)  A leading coefficient of 1 is still printed.

The number of 0's is equal to the number of 1's.
Every prefix of the binary string has at least as many 1's as 0's.

750,Contain Virus,"A virus is spreading rapidly, and your task is to quarantine the infected area by installing walls.

The world is modeled as a 2-D array of cells, where 0 represents uninfected cells, and 1 represents cells contaminated with the virus.  A wall (and only one wall) can be installed between any two 4-directionally adjacent cells, on the shared boundary.

Every night, the virus spreads to all neighboring cells in all four directions unless blocked by a wall.
Resources are limited. Each day, you can install walls around only one region -- the affected area (continuous block of infected cells) that threatens the most uninfected cells the following night. There will never be a tie.

Can you save the day? If so, what is the number of walls required? If not, and the world becomes fully infected, return the number of walls used.

Example 2:

Input: grid = 
[[1,1,1],

736,Parse Lisp Expression,"You are given a string expression representing a Lisp-like expression to return the integer value of.

The syntax for these expressions is given as follows.

An expression is either an integer, a let-expression, an add-expression, a mult-expression, or an assigned variable.  Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.

(An integer could be positive or negative.)

A let-expression takes the form (let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr), where let is always the string ""let"", then there are 1 or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable v1 is assigned the value of the expression e1, the second variable v2 is assigned the value of the expression e2, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let-expression is the value of the expression expr.

An add-expression takes the form (add e1 e2) where add is always the string ""add"", there are always two expressions e1, e2, and this expression evaluates to the addition of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.

A mult-expression takes the form (mult e1 e2) where mult is always the string ""mult"", there are always two expressions e1, e2, and this expression evaluates to the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.

For the purposes of this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names.  A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits.  Additionally for your convenience, the names ""add"", ""let"", or ""mult"" are protected and will never be used as variable names.

Finally, there is the concept of scope.  When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially.  It is guaranteed that every expression is legal.  Please see the examples for more details on scope.


Evaluation Examples:

Input: (add 1 2)
Output: 3

Input: (mult 3 (add 2 3))
Output: 15

Input: (let x 2 (mult x 5))
Output: 10

Input: (let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y))))
Output: 14
Explanation: In the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x,
we check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate.
Since x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3.

Input: (let x 3 x 2 x)
Output: 2
Explanation: Assignment in let statements is processed sequentially.

Input: (let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y))
Output: 5
Explanation: The first (add x y) evaluates as 3, and is assigned to x.
The second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5.

Input: (let x 2 (add (let x 3 (let x 4 x)) x))
Output: 6
Explanation: Even though (let x 4 x) has a deeper scope, it is outside the context
of the final x in the add-expression.  That final x will equal 2.

Input: (let a1 3 b2 (add a1 1) b2) 
Output 4
Explanation: Variable names can contain digits after the first character.



Note:
The given string expression is well formatted: There are no leading or trailing spaces, there is only a single space separating different components of the string, and no space between adjacent parentheses.  The expression is guaranteed to be legal and evaluate to an integer.
The length of expression is at most 2000.  (It is also non-empty, as that would not be a legal expression.)

Given a coordinate (sr, sc) representing the starting pixel (row and column) of the flood fill, and a pixel value newColor, ""flood fill"" the image.

To perform a ""flood fill"", consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color as the starting pixel), and so on.  Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with the newColor.

Example 1:

Input: 
image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]
sr = 1, sc = 1, newColor = 2
Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
Explanation: 
From the center of the image (with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1)), all pixels connected 
by a path of the same color as the starting pixel are colored with the new color.
Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected

Note:
The length of image and image[0] will be in the range [1, 50].

MyCalendar.book(5, 15); // returns false
MyCalendar.book(5, 10); // returns true
MyCalendar.book(25, 55); // returns true
Explanation: 
The first two events can be booked.  The third event can be double booked.
The fourth event (5, 15) can't be booked, because it would result in a triple booking.
The fifth event (5, 10) can be booked, as it does not use time 10 which is already double booked.
The sixth event (25, 55) can be booked, as the time in [25, 40) will be double booked with the third event;

The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the index's right.

If the index is on the left edge of the array, then the left sum is 0 because there are no elements to the left. This also applies to the right edge of the array.

Return the leftmost pivot index. If no such index exists, return -1.",['array']
722,Remove Comments,"Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array where source[i] is the i-th line of the source code.  This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character \n.

In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.

The string // denotes a line comment, which represents that it and rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.

The string /* denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of */ should be ignored.  (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.)  To be clear, the string /*/ does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.

The first effective comment takes precedence over others: if the string // occurs in a block comment, it is ignored. Similarly, if the string /* occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.

If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.

There will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.  For example, source = ""string s = ""/* Not a comment. */"";"" will not be a test case.  (Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.)

It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so /* outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.

Finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments.  Please see the examples below for details.


After removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.

Example 1:

Input: 
source = [""/*Test program */"", ""int main()"", ""{ "", ""  // variable declaration "", ""int a, b, c;"", ""/* This is a test"", ""   multiline  "", ""   comment for "", ""   testing */"", ""a = b + c;"", ""}""]

The line by line code is visualized as below:
/*Test program */
int main()
{ 
  // variable declaration 
int a, b, c;
/* This is a test
   multiline  
   comment for 
   testing */
a = b + c;
}

Output: [""int main()"",""{ "",""  "",""int a, b, c;"",""a = b + c;"",""}""]

The line by line code is visualized as below:
int main()
{ 
  
int a, b, c;
a = b + c;
}

Explanation: 
The string /* denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. The string // denotes line 4 as comments.



Example 2:

Input: 
source = [""a/*comment"", ""line"", ""more_comment*/b""]
Output: [""ab""]
Explanation: The original source string is ""a/*comment\nline\nmore_comment*/b"", where we have bolded the newline characters.  After deletion, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string ""ab"", which when delimited by newline characters becomes [""ab""].



Note:
The length of source is in the range [1, 100].
The length of source[i] is in the range [0, 80].

Example 1:

Input: s1 = ""sea"", s2 = ""eat""
Output: 231
Explanation: Deleting ""s"" from ""sea"" adds the ASCII value of ""s"" (115) to the sum.
Deleting ""t"" from ""eat"" adds 116 to the sum.
At the end, both strings are equal, and 115 + 116 = 231 is the minimum sum possible to achieve this.



Example 2:

Input: s1 = ""delete"", s2 = ""leet""
Output: 403
Explanation: Deleting ""dee"" from ""delete"" to turn the string into ""let"",
adds 100[d]+101[e]+101[e] to the sum.  Deleting ""e"" from ""leet"" adds 101[e] to the sum.
At the end, both strings are equal to ""let"", and the answer is 100+101+101+101 = 403.

699,Falling Squares,"On an infinite number line (x-axis), we drop given squares in the order they are given.

The i-th square dropped (positions[i] = (left, side_length)) is a square with the left-most point being positions[i][0] and sidelength positions[i][1].

The square is dropped with the bottom edge parallel to the number line, and from a higher height than all currently landed squares. We wait for each square to stick before dropping the next.

The squares are infinitely sticky on their bottom edge, and will remain fixed to any positive length surface they touch (either the number line or another square). Squares dropped adjacent to each other will not stick together prematurely.
 

Return a list ans of heights. Each height ans[i] represents the current highest height of any square we have dropped, after dropping squares represented by positions[0], positions[1], ..., positions[i].

Example 1:


Input: [[1, 2], [2, 3], [6, 1]]
Output: [2, 5, 5]
Explanation:


After the first drop of positions[0] = [1, 2]: _aa _aa ------- The maximum height of any square is 2.

After the second drop of positions[1] = [2, 3]: __aaa __aaa __aaa _aa__ _aa__ -------------- The maximum height of any square is 5. The larger square stays on top of the smaller square despite where its center of gravity is, because squares are infinitely sticky on their bottom edge.

After the third drop of positions[1] = [6, 1]: __aaa __aaa __aaa _aa _aa___a -------------- The maximum height of any square is still 5. Thus, we return an answer of [2, 5, 5].

Explanation: 
The price of A is $2, and $3 for B, $4 for C. 
You may pay $4 for 1A and 1B, and $9 for 2A ,2B and 1C. 
You need to buy 1A ,2B and 1C, so you may pay $4 for 1A and 1B (special offer #1), and $3 for 1B, $4 for 1C. 
You cannot add more items, though only $9 for 2A ,2B and 1C.



Note:

There are at most 6 kinds of items, 100 special offers.
For each item, you need to buy at most 6 of them.
You are not allowed to buy more items than you want, even if that would lower the overall price.","['dynamic-programming', 'depth-first-search']"

636,Exclusive Time of Functions,"On a single-threaded CPU, we execute a program containing n functions. Each function has a unique ID between 0 and n-1.

Function calls are stored in a call stack: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.

You are given a list logs, where logs[i] represents the ith log message formatted as a string ""{function_id}:{""start"" | ""end""}:{timestamp}"". For example, ""0:start:3"" means a function call with function ID 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3, and ""1:end:2"" means a function call with function ID 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.

A function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for 2 time units and another call executing for 1 time unit, the exclusive time is 2 + 1 = 3.

Return the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the ith index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID i.",['stack']

Given n online courses represented by pairs (t,d), your task is to find the maximal number of courses that can be taken.

Example:


Input: [[100, 200], [200, 1300], [1000, 1250], [2000, 3200]]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
There're totally 4 courses, but you can take 3 courses at most:
First, take the 1st course, it costs 100 days so you will finish it on the 100th day, and ready to take the next course on the 101st day.
Second, take the 3rd course, it costs 1000 days so you will finish it on the 1100th day, and ready to take the next course on the 1101st day. 
Third, take the 2nd course, it costs 200 days so you will finish it on the 1300th day. 
The 4th course cannot be taken now, since you will finish it on the 3300th day, which exceeds the closed date.

591,Tag Validator,"Given a string representing a code snippet, you need to implement a tag validator to parse the code and return whether it is valid. A code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold:

The code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid.
A closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : <TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>. Among them, <TAG_NAME> is the start tag, and </TAG_NAME> is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.
A valid TAG_NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the TAG_NAME is invalid.
A valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched <, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the TAG_CONTENT is invalid.
A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.
A < is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent >. And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME  (not necessarily valid).
The cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>. 
CDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters. 


Valid Code Examples:

Input: ""<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>""
Output: True
Explanation: 
The code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. 
The TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. 
Although CDATA_CONTENT has unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as tag.
So TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.

Input: ""<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>""
Output: True
Explanation:
We first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.
start_tag -> ""<DIV>""
end_tag -> ""</DIV>""
tag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.
text1 -> "">>  ![cdata[]] ""
cdata -> ""<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>"", where the CDATA_CONTENT is ""<div>]>""
text2 -> ""]]>>]""

The reason why start_tag is NOT ""<DIV>>>"" is because of the rule 6.
The reason why cdata is NOT ""<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>"" is because of the rule 7.



Invalid Code Examples:

Input: ""<A>  <B> </A>   </B>""
Output: False
Explanation: Unbalanced. If ""<A>"" is closed, then ""<B>"" must be unmatched, and vice versa.

Input: ""<DIV>  div tag is not closed  <DIV>""
Output: False

Input: ""<DIV>  unmatched <  </DIV>""
Output: False

Input: ""<DIV> closed tags with invalid tag name  <b>123</b> </DIV>""
Output: False

566,Reshape the Matrix,"In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape', which can reshape a matrix into a new one with different size but keep its original data.



You're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array, and two positive integers r and c representing the row number and column number of the wanted reshaped matrix, respectively.

 The reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.



If the 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.


Example 1:

Input: 
nums = 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 1, c = 4
Output: 
[[1,2,3,4]]
Explanation:The row-traversing of nums is [1,2,3,4]. The new reshaped matrix is a 1 * 4 matrix, fill it row by row by using the previous list.



Example 2:

Input: 
nums = 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 2, c = 4
Output:

Suppose the first element in S starts with the selection of element A[i] of index = i, the next element in S should be A[A[i]], and then A[A[A[i]]]… By that analogy, we stop adding right before a duplicate element occurs in S.

 

Example 1:


Input: A = [5,4,0,3,1,6,2]
Output: 4
Explanation:

554,Brick Wall,"There is a brick wall in front of you. The wall is rectangular and has several rows of bricks. The bricks have the same height but different width. You want to draw a vertical line from the top to the bottom and cross the least bricks.

The brick wall is represented by a list of rows. Each row is a list of integers representing the width of each brick in this row from left to right.

If your line go through the edge of a brick, then the brick is not considered as crossed. You need to find out how to draw the line to cross the least bricks and return the number of crossed bricks.

You cannot draw a line just along one of the two vertical edges of the wall, in which case the line will obviously cross no bricks. 

 

Example:


Input: [[1,2,2,1],

553,Optimal Division,"Given a list of positive integers, the adjacent integers will perform the float division. For example, [2,3,4] -> 2 / 3 / 4.

However, you can add any number of parenthesis at any position to change the priority of operations. You should find out how to add parenthesis to get the maximum result, and return the corresponding expression in string format. Your expression should NOT contain redundant parenthesis.

Example:

Input: [1000,100,10,2]
Output: ""1000/(100/10/2)""
Explanation:
1000/(100/10/2) = 1000/((100/10)/2) = 200
However, the bold parenthesis in ""1000/((100/10)/2)"" are redundant, since they don't influence the operation priority. So you should return ""1000/(100/10/2)"". 

Other cases:
1000/(100/10)/2 = 50
1000/(100/(10/2)) = 50
1000/100/10/2 = 0.5

For each move, you could choose any m (1 ≤ m ≤ n) washing machines, and pass one dress of each washing machine to one of its adjacent washing machines  at the same time .  

Given an integer array representing the number of dresses in each washing machine from left to right on the line, you should find the minimum number of moves to make all the washing machines have the same number of dresses. If it is not possible to do it, return -1.

Example1

Input: [1,0,5]

Output: 3

Explanation: 
1st move:    1     0     1     1     4

514,Freedom Trail,"In the video game Fallout 4, the quest ""Road to Freedom"" requires players to reach a metal dial called the ""Freedom Trail Ring"", and use the dial to spell a specific keyword in order to open the door.

Given a string ring, which represents the code engraved on the outer ring and another string key, which represents the keyword needs to be spelled. You need to find the minimum number of steps in order to spell all the characters in the keyword.

Initially, the first character of the ring is aligned at 12:00 direction. You need to spell all the characters in the string key one by one by rotating the ring clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string key aligned at 12:00 direction and then by pressing the center button.

At the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character key[i]:


	You can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise one place, which counts as 1 step. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of the string ring's characters at the 12:00 direction, where this character must equal to the character key[i].
	If the character key[i] has been aligned at the 12:00 direction, you need to press the center button to spell, which also counts as 1 step. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage), otherwise, you've finished all the spelling.


Example:


 


Input: ring = ""godding"", key = ""gd""
Output: 4
Explanation:
For the first key character 'g', since it is already in place, we just need 1 step to spell this character. 
For the second key character 'd', we need to rotate the ring ""godding"" anticlockwise by two steps to make it become ""ddinggo"".
Also, we need 1 more step for spelling.
So the final output is 4.


Note:


	Length of both ring and key will be in range 1 to 100.
	There are only lowercase letters in both strings and might be some duplcate characters in both strings.

Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects. 



You are given several projects. For each project i, it has a pure profit Pi and a minimum capital of Ci is needed to start the corresponding project. Initially, you have W capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.



To sum up, pick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital, and output your final maximized capital.


Example 1:

Input: k=2, W=0, Profits=[1,2,3], Capital=[0,1,1].

Output: 4

Explanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.
             After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.
             With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.
             Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.
             Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.

13,Roman to Integer,"Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.


Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:


	I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
	X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
	C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

8,String to Integer (atoi),"Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).

The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:


	Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
	Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
	Read in next the characters until the next non-digit charcter or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
	Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. ""123"" -> 123, ""0032"" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
	If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.
	Return the integer as the final result.


Note:


	Only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.
	Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.","['math', 'string']"
7,Reverse Integer,"Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.
