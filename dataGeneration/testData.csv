1,Two Sum,https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum,"Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.","['array', 'hash-table']"
1928,Number of Orders in the Backlog,https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-orders-in-the-backlog,"You are given a 2D integer array orders, where each orders[i] = [pricei, amounti, orderTypei] denotes that amounti orders have been placed of type orderTypei at the price pricei. The orderTypei is:


	0 if it is a batch of buy orders, or
	1 if it is a batch of sell orders.


Note that orders[i] represents a batch of amounti independent orders with the same price and order type. All orders represented by orders[i] will be placed before all orders represented by orders[i+1] for all valid i.

There is a backlog that consists of orders that have not been executed. The backlog is initially empty. When an order is placed, the following happens:


	If the order is a buy order, you look at the sell order with the smallest price in the backlog. If that sell order's price is smaller than or equal to the current buy order's price, they will match and be executed, and that sell order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the buy order is added to the backlog.
	Vice versa, if the order is a sell order, you look at the buy order with the largest price in the backlog. If that buy order's price is larger than or equal to the current sell order's price, they will match and be executed, and that buy order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the sell order is added to the backlog.


Return the total amount of orders in the backlog after placing all the orders from the input. Since this number can be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.","['heap', 'greedy']"
456,132 Pattern,https://leetcode.com/problems/132-pattern,"Given an array of n integers nums, a 132 pattern is a subsequence of three integers nums[i], nums[j] and nums[k] such that i < j < k and nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j].

Return true if there is a 132 pattern in nums, otherwise, return false.

Follow up: The O(n^2) is trivial, could you come up with the O(n logn) or the O(n) solution?",['stack']
798,Transform to Chessboard,https://leetcode.com/problems/transform-to-chessboard,"An N x N board contains only 0s and 1s. In each move, you can swap any 2 rows with each other, or any 2 columns with each other.

What is the minimum number of moves to transform the board into a ""chessboard"" - a board where no 0s and no 1s are 4-directionally adjacent? If the task is impossible, return -1.","['array', 'math']"
